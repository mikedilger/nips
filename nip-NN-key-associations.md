Many people have multiple devices.  If anyone wishes to store a private key in a secure
enclave, they cannot use that same private key on their other devices.

This NIP proposes a mechanism of associating multiple public keys into the same identity
so that if someone is following one of them, they are alerted about the others.

In order to maintain backwards compatibility, one of the public keys will be considered
primary and the other keys will be considered subkeys.
