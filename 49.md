Encrypted Private Key
---------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:mikedilger`

This NIP defines a method by which clients can encrypt a user's private key with a passphrase for storage purposes and optionally for import/export between clients.

Clients should handle key material securely, never writing unencrypted private keys to longterm storage, and should discourage the use of cutting and pasting unencrypted private keys.

Clients should offer users the option to import and export private keys in a passphrase-encrypted form.

Symmetric Encryption Key derivation
-----------------------------------

PASSPHRASE = read from the user

LOG\_N = Let the user choose one byte representing a power of 2 (e.g. 18 represents 262,144) which is used as the number of rounds for scrypt. Larger numbers take more time and more memory, and offer better protection:

    | LOG\_N | MEMORY REQUIRED | APPROX TIME ON FAST COMPUTER |
    |--------|-----------------|----------------------------- |
    | 16     | 64 MiB          | 100 ms                       |
    | 18     | 256 MiB         |                              |
    | 20     | 1 GiB           | 2 seconds                    |
    | 21     | 2 GiB           |                              |
    | 22     | 4 GiB           |                              |

SALT = 16 random bytes

SYMMETRIC_KEY = scrypt(passphrase=PASSPHRASE, salt=SALT, log\_n=LOG\_N, r=8, p=1)

The symmetric key should be 32 bytes long.

This symmetric encryption key is temporary and should be zeroed and discarded after use and not stored or reused for any other purpose.


Encrypting a private key
------------------------

The private key encryption process is as follows:

PRIVATE\_KEY = User's private (secret) secp256k1 key as 32 raw bytes (not hex or bech32 encoded!)

KEY\_SECURITY\_BYTE = one of:
  0x00 - if the key has been known to have been handled insecurely (stored unencrypted, cut and paste unencrypted, etc)
  0x01 - if the key has NOT been known to have been handled insecurely (stored unencrypted, cut and paste unencrypted, etc)
  0x02 - if the client does not track this data

ASSOCIATED\_DATA = KEY\_SECURITY\_BYTE

NONCE = 24 byte nonce generated with the help of XChaCha20-Poly1305 (use that algorithm's nonce generator)

CIPHERTEXT = XChaCha20-Poly1305(
    plaintext=PRIVATE\_KEY,
    associated_data=ASSOCIATED\_DATA,
    nonce=NONCE,
    key=SYMMETRIC\_KEY
)

VERSION\_NUMBER = 0x02

CIPHERTEXT_CONCATENATION = concat(
    VERSION\_NUMBER,
    LOG\_N,
    SALT,
    NONCE,
    ASSOCIATED\_DATA,
    CIPHERTEXT
)

ENCRYPTED\_PRIVATE\_KEY = bech32_encode('ncryptsec', CIPHERTEXT\_CONCATENATION)

The output prior to bech32 encoding should be 91 bytes long.

The decryption process operates in the reverse.


Keeping key material secure
---------------------------

It is strongly recommended that software that engages in this process zeroes the memory used by private keys and passwords before freeing it to the operating system.

Test Data
---------

The following encrypted private key:

`ncryptsec1qgg9947rlpvqu76pj5ecreduf9jxhselq2nae2kghhvd5g7dgjtcxfqtd67p9m0w57lspw8gsq6yphnm8623nsl8xn9j4jdzz84zm3frztj3z7s35vpzmqf6ksu8r89qk5z2zxfmu5gv8th8wclt0h4p`

When decrypted with password='nostr' and log_n=16 yields the following hex-encoded private key:

`3501454135014541350145413501453fefb02227e449e57cf4d3a3ce05378683`

NOTE: this hex encoded private key happens to collide with `cafebabecafebabecafebabecafebabecafebabecafebabecafebabecafebabe` as a private key, but is the more canonical form of it.

The reverse process is non-deterministic due to the random nonce.

Discussion
----------

This NIP serves a very similar purpose as PKCS #8 and BIP-38 do (not the much more well known BIP-39 seedword passphrase BIP). Those documents are referenced at the end.

### On Key Derivation

Passwords make poor cryptographic keys. Prior to use as a cryptographic key, two things need to happen:

1. An encryption key needs to be deterministically created from the password such that is has a uniform functionally random distribution of bits, such that the symmetric encryption algorithm's assumptions are valid, and
2. A slow irreversible algorithm should be injected into the process, so that brute-force attempts to decrypt by trying many passwords are severely hampered.

These are achieved using a password-based key derivation function. We use scrypt, which has been proven to be maximally memory hard and which several cryptographers have indicated to the author is better than argon2 even though argon2 won a competition in 2015.

### On the symmetric encryption algorithm

XChaCha20-Poly1305 is typically favored by cryptographers over AES and is less associated with the U.S. government.  It (or it's earlier variant without the 'X') is gaining wide usage, is used in TLS and OpenSSH, and is available in most modern crypto libraries.

Motivation
----------

There will always be a wide selection of clients. Users should be able to move/share their identity between them without risking exposing their private key. Short of the use of hardware security token support, some encryption algorithm such as the one in this NIP is warranted.

Today, when users of nostr wish to switch to another client, or use multiple clients, they export their private key in bech32 'nsec' format, which is not encrypted in any way. Any leakage of such an exported key compromises their security. And yet people typically cut-and-paste such keys and/or store them in a file on their computer.

It is not recommended that users publish these encrypted private keys to nostr, as cracking a key may become easier when an attacker can amass many encrypted private keys.
